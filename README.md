# net-info-linux
Small Linux Bash Script that displays practically relevant device network information in easy-to-digest format: your private and public IP addresses, the active network interface you're using (with a plain-English description), the range of IP addresses your current network supports (subnet info), your currently active DNS servers, and your SSID (if on Wi-Fi). This script will work on most modern Linux distributions with standard tools installed.
